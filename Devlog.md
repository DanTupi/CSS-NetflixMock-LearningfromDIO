# DEVLOG - NETcloneFlix

- 2021/02/10 : The only major change I made from the class was the images of movies, and in the subject of responsiveness of the page I removed the movie description when screen bellow 800px;

  


### To do

- Implement links on the buttons (not hard, just don't have time);
- I still not happy with the responsiveness of the main movie;
- Implement a carousel in the main movie;
- try to do this carousel without jquery;
- maybe change the overall subject;
