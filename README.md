# CSS-NetflixMock-LearningfromDIO

This repository is a fruit of an exercise of CSS, Jquery and JavaScript from [Digital Innovation One.](https://web.digitalinnovation.one/lab/recriando-a-interface-do-netflix/learning/2069ecdf-36d6-4ad7-87fd-dab5632e722e)

This class we had to do a clone of Netflix main page.

Check out the DevLog with more ideas and changes made to the project.
